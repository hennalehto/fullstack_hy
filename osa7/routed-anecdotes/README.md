## Exercises from the course Full Stack Development (fullstackopen.com)

## 7.1
Add React Router to the application so that by clicking links in the Menu-component the view can be changed.
At the root of the application, meaning the path ` / `, show the list of anecdotes:

The Footer-component should always be visible at the bottom.

The creation of a new anecdote should happen e.g. in the path create:

Navigating to the page showing the single anecdote is done by clicking the name of that anecdote

## 7.3
The default functionality of the creation form is quite confusing, because after creating a new anecdote using the form nothing seems to be happening.

Improve the functionality such that after creating a new anecdote the application transitions automatically to showing the view for all anecdotes and the user is shown a notification informing them of this successful creation for the next 10 seconds:
