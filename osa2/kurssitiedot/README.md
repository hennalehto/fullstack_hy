## Exercises from the course Full Stack Development (fullstackopen.com)

## 2.1
Let's finish the code for rendering course contents from exercises 1.1 - 1.5.

Let's change the App component like so:
```
const App = () => {
  const course = {
    name: 'Half Stack application development',
    parts: [
      {
        name: 'Fundamentals of React',
        exercises: 10,
        id: 1
      },
      {
        name: 'Using props to pass data',
        exercises: 7,
        id: 2
      },
      {
        name: 'State of a component',
        exercises: 14,
        id: 3
      }
    ]
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <Course course={course} />
    </div>
  )
}
```
Define a component responsible for formatting a single course called Course.
## 2.2
Show also the sum of the exercises of the course.
## 2.3
If you haven't done so already, calculate the sum of exercises with the array method reduce.
## 2.4
Let's extend our application to allow for an arbitrary number of courses:
```
const App = () => {
  const courses = [
    {
      name: 'Half Stack application development',
      id: 1,
      parts: [
        {
          name: 'Fundamentals of React',
          exercises: 10,
          id: 1
        },
        {
          name: 'Using props to pass data',
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2
        },
        {
          name: 'State of a component',
          exercises: 14,
          id: 3
        },
        {
          name: 'Redux',
          exercises: 11,
          id: 4
        }
      ]
    }, 
    {
      name: 'Node.js',
      id: 2,
      parts: [
        {
          name: 'Routing',
          exercises: 3,
          id: 1
        },
        {
          name: 'Middlewares',
          exercises: 7,
          id: 2
        }
      ]
    }
  ]

  return (
    <div>
      // ...
    </div>
  )
}
```
## 2.5
Declare the Course component as a separate module, which is imported by the App component. You can include all subcomponents of the course into the same module.
